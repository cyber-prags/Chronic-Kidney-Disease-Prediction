# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
In this project I deployed various models to predict whether a person has Chronic Kidney Disease or not based on a certain set of parameters. Since it is a classification problem, we have used a **RandomForest Classifier** for making classifications and hypertuned it to attain the best possible accuracy on our test data.

## Stages of the project:

- Data loading

- Data Pre-processing

- Feature Engineering

- Feature Extraction

- Model Building

- Hyper-parameter tuning
